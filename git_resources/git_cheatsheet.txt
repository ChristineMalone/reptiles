Git Cheat Sheet
==========================

Clone a Repo
--------------------------
git clone <repo link from github>

### The Basic Idiom
git pull
	let me see what others have done
	resolve merge conflicts early
git add <filename>
	let me bundle some work together
git commit -m "my comment"
	let me make a note about that bundle
	-m -- that’s a flag that says use no editor, use the string
git push
	send it up to the remote repo

### Other Helpful Commands
git status
	show me what’s happening right now
git log
	show me the timeline
	to exit the log view, type q
git log --pretty=oneline
	show me a simplified log
	to exit the log view, type q
git stash save "note about what I am saving"
	My current work is not ready to be committed but I want to git pull and see what’s going on with the remote repo
git stash pop
	apply the last stashed change
git stash list
	show me all stashed changes
	to exit the diff view, type q
git diff filename
	show me what's changed in this file since last commit
	to exit the diff view, type q
git commit --amend
	correct typos in commit messages for commits that haven't been pushed

### Manipulating the Timeline

git reset <SHA/Commit ID from log/HEAD@{some number of step back}>

### Branches
git branch
	what branch am I in?
git branch -a
	see local and remote branches
git checkout --track origin/<branch name>

git checkout master
	go to master branch
git merge <branch name>
	add changes form <branch name> to master
